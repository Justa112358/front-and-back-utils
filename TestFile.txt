"...something happened. It was not a great battle, nor an earthquake,
nor a coronation, but something more important than all those put together.
A BABY-GIRL WAS BORN; and her father was a king; and her mother was a queen;
and her uncles and aunts were princes and princesses; and her first-cousins 
were dukes and duchesses; and not one of her second-cousins was less than a 
marquis or marchioness, or of their third-cousins less than an earl or countess: 
and below a countess they did not care to count. So the little girl was Somebody;
and yet for all that, strange to say, the first thing she did was to cry.
I told you it was a strange country."
-George MacDonald, "A Double Story"
